### Description

###### In this program, we use the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) to determine the distance between particles and to detect if said particles are colliding. Physics plays a major role in bouncing the particles off of one another. We use the [Elastic Collision Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision) to maintain all energy within the particles. No energy is lost! It also bounces particles in a direction that depends on the angle of collision. Thus, creating a realistic bounce effect.
